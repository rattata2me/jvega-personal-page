I discovered that by using Stable diffusion models and simple shadering I can improve rendering and post styling. This might be something that is getting interesting lately. By using gradio and stable diffusion 1.5 I rendered some stylized images. Afterwards, i thought about integrating frame interpolation into the workflow and to add custom color correction to prevent flickering. By automatically inserting these extra frames, I achieved smoother and more natural motion in the videos plus keeping better overall structural stability. The results are not incredible but promising.

In this example I assigned a weight function for each automata which computed the best location in the next move based on distance to other automata and “fuel” locations. Mixed with a vornoi style noise rules, this creates emerging biological patterns similar to fungi structures.
