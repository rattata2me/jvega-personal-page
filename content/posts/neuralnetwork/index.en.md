I made a simple implementation in C of the classical sigmoid neural network. As its made from scratch in C code it can easily be ported to many appliances.
For now code correctly feedforwards when a correct neural data sheet is given. Tested on various neural networks model based on the [MINST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  

Code can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/rattata2me/minimalneuron)
